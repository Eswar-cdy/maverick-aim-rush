# General (Maverick Aim Rush)
- Be concise; prefer code over prose.
- Propose **small diffs** and reference file paths.
- Respect existing style/formatting.
- Avoid speculative refactors; make reversible edits.
- Use code references for existing files; use fenced code blocks for proposed code.
- Ask clarifying questions only when truly blocked.
