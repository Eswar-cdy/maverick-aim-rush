Project: Maverick Aim Rush

General
- Keep answers concise and direct; prioritize code over prose.
- Use code references for existing files; use fenced code blocks for proposed code.
- Respect existing indentation and formatting.
- Avoid speculative changes; propose minimal, reversible edits.

Backend (Django/DRF)
- Prefer Django REST Framework patterns: serializers, viewsets, routers.
- Use PostgreSQL via environment-based DATABASES config; no SQLite in production.
- Write migrations for model changes; keep data migrations idempotent.
- Validate inputs in serializers; avoid business logic in views.
- Return paginated responses for list endpoints by default.
- **MANDATORY: All new endpoints must be under /api/v1/ path. No exceptions.**
- **MANDATORY: Add schema snapshot tests for all new endpoints.**

Auth/Security
- Use JWT or cookie-based auth consistent with `tracker/csrf_jwt.py`.
- Enforce permissions (`permissions.py`) and throttling where applicable.
- Never log secrets; use settings/env variables only.

Testing
- Default to `pytest` style if present; otherwise Django test runner.
- Add tests for serializers, views, and critical utils.

Frontend
- Use React components in `frontend/app/` with functional components and hooks.
- Keep API calls in a dedicated client; no inline fetches in components.
- Validate props with TypeScript or PropTypes if TypeScript not available.

Performance/Infra
- Prefer async tasks for heavy workloads; avoid blocking request/response cycle.
- Cache read-heavy endpoints where safe.

Docs
- For new APIs: update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` and relevant README sections.
